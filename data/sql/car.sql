Court of Appealsâ€™ contrary opinion reversed, post-conviction court judgment ordering new trial affirmed. \n\nDefendant was accused of murdering the victim with a firearm. The defense theory was that another man, Baines, was the actual murderer. Police discovered a revolver during an unrelated search of Bainesâ€™s residence.\n\nThe stateâ€™s expert did not think that the gun could be definitively linked to the shooting. \n\nThe defense obtained a possible expert, who opined that Bainesâ€™s gun matched the bullet taken from the victim. That expertâ€™s qualifications were discussed during a pre-trial hearing, but the defense did not call him to testify. \n\nThe post-conviction court held that the defense expert raised a doubt about defendantâ€™s guilt and there was no reason not to call the expert, and therefore it was ineffective not to do so. The court further found that the error was harmful. \n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that a reasonable attorney could have chosen not to call the expert, and that counsel has acted reasonably in hiring experts and investigating the ballistics issue. The dissent argued that the choice to investigate and the choice to call a witness were separate, and that failing to call the witness was unreasonable. \n\nIn concluding that trial counsel had acted unreasonably, the Supreme Court observed that the post-conviction court found that trial counsel had misunderstood the helpfulness of the defense expertâ€™s testimony.

But the forensic examination also revealed that defendant had searched for information about child abuse at other times, and that evidence was also admitted.
